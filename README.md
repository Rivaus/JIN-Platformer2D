# JIN-Platformer2D

The idea of this academic project was to create a 2D platformer controller from scratch within Unity. It was realized
as a pair. We could not use standard physic components such as RigidBody. Moreover, the platformer
controller had to provide a lot of settings to easily customize the behaviour of the player in the inspector.

To do this project, we firstly played platformers games (like Super Mario, Super Meat Boy or Celeste)
to get the different features a platformer should have. We also read articles and watched devblogs or
Youtube videos about 2d game creation to obtain as much information as possible.

Thanks to these researches, we develop a controller with a lot of parameters editable :

(This project was focused on the creation of a 2d controller not on programming, that is why the code is a little bit messy
and only in one class)

Our project was only made to be played with a joystick.
